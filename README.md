# Earthquake Prediction Model

Our team developed a comprehensive predictive model for earthquakes, leveraging the power of machine learning to analyze and predict seismic activities. The project aimed to provide accurate predictions that could potentially contribute to early warning systems and disaster preparedness.

## Overview

We employed three sophisticated machine learning algorithms—**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Neural Network**, and **Random Forest Regressor**—to create models capable of predicting seismic events based on historical earthquake data.

## My Contributions

- **Random Forest Regressor Model:** I played a key role in the development and optimization of the **Random Forest Regressor** model. This model was instrumental in capturing the complex relationships within the data, contributing significantly to the overall predictive accuracy.
  
- **Data Preprocessing and Feature Selection:** I was responsible for conducting data preprocessing, which included cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing features. Additionally, I performed feature selection to identify the most relevant factors influencing earthquake predictions, ensuring that the models were both efficient and effective.

- **Toolset Utilization:** Throughout the project, I utilized a variety of powerful tools and libraries, including:
  - **Python** for scripting and model implementation.
  - **Matplotlib** for creating visually appealing graphs that depict the model’s predictions and performance.
  - **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.

- **Visualization:** I created clear and informative visualizations to present the results of our models. These graphs helped in understanding the models' performance and communicating the findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the potential of machine learning in predicting natural disasters like earthquakes. By combining multiple algorithms and fine-tuning them through rigorous preprocessing and feature selection, our model demonstrates a significant step towards reliable seismic activity prediction.
